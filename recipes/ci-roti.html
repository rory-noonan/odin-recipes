    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups bread flour (520 g)</li>
      <li>1 eggs , room temperature</li>
      <li>3 tablespoon unsalted butter (40 g), melted</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>1 Â¼ cup water (310 ml)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>The Dough</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a standing mixer bowl, add in flour, salt, egg, melted butter,
        condensed milk and water. Mix to incorporate and knead for 10 minutes.
        Leave to rest for 10 minutes and knead for another 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into 10 small balls. Coat each ball generously with
        unsalted butter and place them in a container that has been generously
        buttered. Cover the container tightly with cling film and keep in the
        fridge overnight.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Shaping</h3>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>
        The next day. Spread some unsalted butter on the working surface. Take
        one ball and lightly flatten it. Press and push the dough with the heel
        of your palm to make it bigger. Stretch it as thin as possible, until
        you can almost see through it. Now and then spread some soften unsalted
        butter on it to help the stretching. Optional, lift up one edge of the
        dough and gently pull to stretch it even more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scrape and push the upper end of the dough to the middle. Do the same to
        the lower end, forming a wrinkle thin log. Starting at one end of the
        log, roll it into a circle and tuck the other end inside. Leave aside
        for 10 minutes before cooking. Meanwhile you can continue with the rest
        of the balls.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cooking</h3>
    <ol start="5">
      <li>
        Once ready to cook, take one rolled circle and flatten it into more or
        less 10-15 cm diameter. Heat some unsalted butter on a pan using medium
        heat. Place the flatten dough on the pan. Cook for several minutes and
        then flip. Continue cooking for some minutes more.

      <li>
        This is important for a fluffy roti canai. Remove the cooked roti canai
        and place it on a working surface. Immediately yet carefully grab it
        using both of your hands and squeeze it to the center. We want to fluff
        it. You can see this part more clear in the video above.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep the roti canai under a kitchen cloth to keep them warm. They're
        best eaten with dhal curry or any type of curry with some sambal. Enjoy!
